"Helluva boy: Hellboy is beautifully directed, and fantastically acted. Ron Perlman is the best thing to happen to comic books since Stan Lee. He plays Hellboy like he was born to do it.

First of all, I got it and it was nearly impossible to let the air out like they said. Water spilled everywhere. I had 3 people working on it! Sure, it's cool for a little while. But after a few hours of sleep that thing REALLY heats up! I woke up one morning after about 8 sweating profusely because it had gotten so warm. Unbearably hot!
